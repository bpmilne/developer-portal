# Step 7: Check the status of your transfer

You can check the status of the newly created transfer by retrieving the transfer by its URL.

```ruby
require 'dwolla_swagger'

transfer = 'https://api.dwolla.com/transfers/74c9129b-d14a-e511-80da-0aa34a9b2388'
retrieved = DwollaSwagger::TransfersApi.by_id(transfer)

p retrieved[:status] == 'processed' ? "Happy emails" : "Angry emails"
```
