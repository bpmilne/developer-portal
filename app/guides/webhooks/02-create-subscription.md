# Create a webhook subscription
Each application can have multiple subscriptions associated to it. While one subscription is sufficient, you can create as many as you want for redundancy. 

To make the following request, we need to use the `access_token` we just previously obtained. Security considerations:

Your webhook endpoint should only be accessible over TLS (https). Your subscription should include a random, secret key, only known by your application. This secret key should be securely stored and used later when validating the authenticity of the webhook request from Dwolla.
 

```ruby
subscription = DwollaSwagger::WebhooksubscriptionsApi.create({:body => {
  :url => "http://myawesomeapplication.com/destination",
  :secret => "your webhook secret"
}})

p subscription # => https://api-uat.dwolla.com/webhook-subscriptions/5af4c10a-f6de-4ac8-840d-42cb65454216
```
```raw
POST https://api-uat.dwolla.com/webhook-subscriptions
Accept: application/vnd.dwolla.v1.hal+json
Content-Type: application/vnd.dwolla.v1.hal+json
Authorization: Bearer 0Sn0W6kzNicvoWhDbQcVSKLRUpGjIdlPSEYyrHqrDDoRnQwE7Q
{
    "url": "http://myapplication.com/webhooks",
    "secret": "sshhhhhh"
}
```

```python
webhook_api = dwollaswagger.WebhooksubscriptionsApi(client)
subscription = webhook_api.create({
    "url": "http://myapplication.com/webhooks",
    "secret": "sshhhhhh"
})

print(subscription) # => https://api-uat.dwolla.com/webhook-subscriptions/5af4c10a-f6de-4ac8-840d-42cb65454216
```
```php
<?php
$webhookApi = new DwollaSwagger\WebhooksubscriptionsApi($apiClient);
$subscription = $webhookApi->create(array (
  'url' => 'http://myapplication.com/webhooks',
  'secret' => 'sshhhhhh',
));

print($subscription); # => https://api-uat.dwolla.com/webhook-subscriptions/5af4c10a-f6de-4ac8-840d-42cb65454216
?>
```

You can retrieve your newly created subscription by its resource location:

```ruby
retrieved = DwollaSwagger::WebhooksubscriptionApi.id(subscription)

p retrieved.created # => 2015-10-28T16:20:47+00:00
```
