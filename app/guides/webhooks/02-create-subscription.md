# Create a webhook subscription
Each application can have multiple subscriptions associated to it. While one subscription is sufficient, you can create as many as you want for redundancy. 

To make the following request, we need to use the `access_token` we just previously obtained. Security considerations:

Your webhook endpoint should only be accessible over SSL (https).
Your subscription should include a random, secret key, only known by your application. This secret key should be securely stored and used later when validating the authenticity of the webhook request from Dwolla.
 

```ruby
require 'dwolla_swagger'

subscription = DwollaSwagger::WebhooksubscriptionsApi.create({:body => {
  :url => "http://myawesomeapplication.com/destination",
  :secret => "your webhook secret"
}})

p subscription # => https://api-uat.dwolla.com/webhook-subscriptions/5af4c10a-f6de-4ac8-840d-42cb65454216

You can retrieve your newly created subscription by its ID:

```ruby
require 'dwolla_swagger'

retrieved = DwollaSwagger::WebhooksubscriptionApi.id(subscription.split('/')[-1])
retrieved = retrieved.to_hash()
