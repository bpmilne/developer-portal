# Validating webhooks

Assume that your integration is an online marketplace, and that a customer just placed an order on your site. A few days after the customer initiated their payment, your application receives this webhook.

```raw
{
  "id": "2c311238-b9ef-4763-b1cb-03e1aa651227",
  "resourceId": "0089A051-9B79-E511-80DB-0AA34A9B2388",
  "topic": "transfer_completed",
  "timestamp": "2015-10-23T15:35:35.366Z",
  "_links": {
    "self": {
      "href": "https://api-uat.dwolla.com/events/2c311238-b9ef-4763-b1cb-03e1aa651227"
    },
    "account": {
      "href": "https://api-uat.dwolla.com/accounts/b4cdac07-eeca-4059-a29c-48900e453d54"
    },
    "resource": {
      "href": "https://api-uat.dwolla.com/transfers/0089A051-9B79-E511-80DB-0AA34A9B2388"
    }
  }
}

#### Step 1: Authenticating the webhook request
Before we process any data from the webhook weâ€™ll want to validate that the request really came from Dwolla and not someone pretending to be Dwolla. Dwolla signs each webhook request with the `secret` you passed in when you created the webhook subscription. The signature is contained in the `X-Request-Signature` header and is a SHA-1 HMAC hash of the request body with the key being your webhook secret.

You can validate the webhook by generating the same SHA-1 HMAC hash and comparing it to the signature sent with the payload.

```ruby
def verify_signature(payload_body, request_signature)
  signature = OpenSSL::HMAC.hexdigest(OpenSSL::Digest.new("sha1"),
ENV["DWOLLA_WEBHOOK_SECRET"],
payload_body)
  unless Rack::Utils.secure_compare(signature, request_signature)
    halt 500, "Signatures didn't match!"
  end
end
```

#### Step 2: Check for duplicate events
The `topic` field of an event holds [a description](http://docsv2.dwolla.com/#events) of the event, which is similar the subject of an e-mail message.  The `webhook` itself contains _links the the resource impacted by the event that can be used to retrieve more information about the webhook you have received. 

**NOTE**: The `event` must be retrieved with a `client_credentials` granted access_token.

```ruby
require 'dwolla_swagger'

## Assuming Rails-style POST parameter
if params[:webhook] == 'transfer_completed'
  event = DwollaSwagger::EventsApi.id(params[:webhook][:eventId])
elsif params[:webhook] == 'another_event'
  "..."
end
```

Multiple webhooks are fired for `Transfer` events; that is, two `transfer_created` events with different URLs will be fired, one for each customer. To avoid doing any business logic twice, check to see if you have already received a webhook relating to the `Transfer` resource responsible for the event. To do this, keep a queue of events in a database and check to see if an `Event` has the same `self` resource location in `_links` as another event. If not, process the logic for that event. An example could look like this.

```ruby
check_db = ActiveRecord::Base.connection.execute("SELECT * FROM EVENTS WHERE SELF = #{event[:_links][:self].to_s}")

# check_db will be an array of rows returned
unless check_db.length() == 0
    # do something
end
