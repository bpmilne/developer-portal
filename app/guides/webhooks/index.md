# Webhooks

## What is a webhook?
A webhook is a means of notifying a third-party application of the occurrence of an event with some relevant information. In the Dwolla V2 API, webhooks are currently triggered by the following resources: 

- Customers
- Funding Sources
- Transfers

Each webhook sent by the Dwolla API contains an `Event` with `_links` to: the associated resource, account associated with the event, and the customer associated with the event (if applicable). It is important to note that a single API request can trigger multiple webhooks to be fired, e.g. initiating a transfer from an Account to Customer can create the events `transfer_created` and `customer_transfer_created`.
